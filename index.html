      <h1>Project On Console</h1>
      <h2>How do you set up visual studio? First to add a folder on the visual studio app, you need to add a folder from your 
        desktop and then there is an explorer button. You need to click that and then add a folder. </h2>
        <h3>
      Next you will need to add a 
      file that contains index.html, main.js, etc.
      Also, to make it easier to live preview you can add a extension called Live Server. 
      Once you install that you will see a Go Live button on the bottom of your screen. 
      So after you write your code you save and click that and it will open 
      your work in chrome.</h3>
      <h4>
        The Visual Studio app is a software program for developers to write and edit their 
        code. It is also used for advanced code classes or tags. Its user interface 
        is used for software development to edit, 
        debug and build code.</h4>

        <h5>
          The console is an operating system window where 
          users interact with the operating system or with 
          a text-based console application by entering text
          input through the computer keyboard, and by reading
          text output from the computer terminal.
        </h5>
        <h6>
     You print text or number or string in the console screen 
     by using the console.log() tag. After you have declared
     a variable then you write the variable in the brackets ( () ). 
     Then when you live preview you will see whatever you have 
     written on the console screen.
        </h6>
        <h7>
          But how do you open the console screen? All you 
          need to do is right click on your live preview, 
          press inspect, and then change the elements to 
          console on the top right of your screen and voila! 
          You have the console screen.
